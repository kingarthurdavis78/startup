        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey guys!
            <br><br>
            My name is Arthur Hunter and I'm a student at BYU who loves coding and creating games for fun. I started this website as a project for my web programming class in May 2023 and since then, I've been constantly developing new and exciting games for you to enjoy.
            <br><br>
            However, it's important to note that hosting a server and utilizing GPT technology isn't free, which is why I rely on donations to keep the site up and running. Your generosity is greatly appreciated and goes towards the continued development of more awesome games.
            <br><br>
            I'm thrilled to share my passion for game design with you and hope you have a blast playing the party games on kingarthur.click. So, gather your friends and family, and let's get the party started!
